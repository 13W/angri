# angri - Grid Directive for AngularJS

angri is modular grid directive for AngularJS, based on the components of Twitter Bootstrap. It is filterable, pagable,
sizeable and sortable. The following lines will describe the features in detail.

### Pagesize
angri provides a dropdown, which enables you to choose the number of items displayed in the table. The default list
settings are: 10, 15, 30 and 60. If you would like to change the number of items displayed, you may change the line 
24ff in the source. In a future release, we will support a way to modify the items list.
